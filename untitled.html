One example is the complex  fungus-growing ant–microbe symbiosis, which includes ancient host–parasite  coevolution. Fungus-growing ants and the fungi they cultivate for food have an  antagonistic symbiosis with Escovopsis, a specialized microfungus that infects  the ants' fungus gardens. The evolutionary histories of the ant, cultivar and  Escovopsis are highly congruent at the deepest phylogenetic levels, with  specific parasite lineages exclusively associating with corresponding groups of  ants and cultiva. Here, we examine host–parasite specificity at finer  phylogenetic levels, within the most derived clade of fungus-growing ants, the  leaf-cutters (Atta spp. and Acromyrmex spp.).</div><div>    </div>
