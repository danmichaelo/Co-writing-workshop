<h1 data-label="775153" class="ltx_title_section">Leaf cutter ants form a symbiosis with a fungus and a microbe</h1><div>                                      </div><div>    Host–parasite  associations are shaped by coevolutionary dynamics. One example is the complex  fungus-growing ant–microbe symbiosis, which includes ancient host–parasite  coevolution. Fungus-growing ants and the fungi they cultivate for food have an  antagonistic symbiosis with Escovopsis, a specialized microfungus that infects  the ants' fungus gardens. The evolutionary histories of the ant, cultivar and  Escovopsis are highly congruent at the deepest phylogenetic levels, with  specific parasite lineages exclusively associating with corresponding groups of  ants and cultiva. Here, we examine host–parasite specificity at finer  phylogenetic levels, within the most derived clade of fungus-growing ants, the  leaf-cutters (<i>Atta</i> spp. and <i>Acromyrmex</i> spp.).</div><div></div><div>    To  experimentally examine the host specificity of Escovopsis within the  leaf-cutting ant–microbe symbiosis, we selected 15 leaf-cutting ant colonies  maintained in the laboratory, including nine Atta and six Acromyrmex species.  The colonies were maintained in the laboratory for at least 5 days, following  lab protocol of previous studies, to allow the ants to stabilize their fungus  gardens. Pieces of fungus garden material (1cm3) from each nest were placed in  the centre of sterile Petri plates. All worker ants were removed from the  garden pieces. The workerless garden pieces were inoculated with approximately  10mm3 pieces of agar with mature spores of different strains of Escovopsis. To  look at host specificity, each garden piece from all 15 leaf-cutting ant  colonies was infected with one of the 10 selected strains of Escovopsis.</div><div>    </div><div>Virtually  all 675 garden pieces inoculated with Escovopsis were overgrown by the  parasite. Only three garden pieces were not, but they were overgrown by another  fungus.&nbsp; Our results add to other  findings which show a strong susceptibility to infection in the cultivar. We  found that Escovopsis from leaf-cutting ant nests form a monophyletic group and  strains associated with leaf-cutting ants form two main clades. There was a  lack of genetic correlation with their ant hosts; the two main Escovopsis  clades are also uncorrelated with geography, as both clades contain isolates  from Argentina, Panama and Ecuador. In fact, the entire EF-1a gene fragment,  including the introns, is identical for some strains isolated from very  different geographical locations.</div><div>    </div><div>Our  molecular phylogeny of Escovopsis isolates from the leaf-cutter ant–microbe  symbiosis confirms specificity at the broad phylogenetic level, but reveals  frequent host-switching events between species and genera of leaf-cutter ants.  Escovopsis strains isolated from Acromyrmex and Atta gardens occur together in  the same clades, and very closely related strains can even infect the gardens  of both ant genera.&nbsp; Currie (*) recorded  the presence of multiparasite infections in single leaf-cutter ant nests, and our  results show that phylogenetically diverse strains of Escovopsis are capable of  overgrowing all leaf-cutter ant cultivars examined.&nbsp; Experimental evidence from other research  groups (*) support our finding of low host–parasite specificity (*). Thus, our  findings indicate that this host–pathogen association is shaped by the farming  ants having to protect their cultivated fungus from phylogenetically diverse  Escovopsis garden pathogens.</div><div>    </div>
