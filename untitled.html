One example is the complex  fungus-growing ant–microbe symbiosis, which includes ancient host–parasite  coevolution. Fungus-growing ants and the fungi they cultivate for food have an  antagonistic symbiosis with Escovopsis, a specialized microfungus that infects  the ants' fungus gardens. The evolutionary histories of the ant, cultivar and  Escovopsis are highly congruent at the deepest phylogenetic levels, with  specific parasite lineages exclusively associating with corresponding groups of  ants and cultiva. Here, we examine host–parasite specificity at finer  phylogenetic levels, within the most derived clade of fungus-growing ants, the  leaf-cutters (Atta spp. and Acromyrmex spp.).</div><div></div><div>    </div><div>To  experimentally examine the host specificity of Escovopsis within the  leaf-cutting ant–microbe symbiosis, we selected 15 leaf-cutting ant colonies  maintained in the laboratory, including nine Atta and six Acromyrmex species.  The colonies were maintained in the laboratory for at least 5 days, following  lab protocol of previous studies, to allow the ants to stabilize their fungus  gardens. Pieces of fungus garden material (1cm3) from each nest were placed in  the centre of sterile Petri plates. All worker ants were removed from the  garden pieces. The workerless garden pieces were inoculated with approximately  10mm3 pieces of agar with mature spores of different strains of Escovopsis. To  look at host specificity, each garden piece from all 15 leaf-cutting ant  colonies was infected with one of the 10 selected strains of Escovopsis.</div><div>    </div>
