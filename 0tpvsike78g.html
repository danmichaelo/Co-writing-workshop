<div>Our  molecular phylogeny of Escovopsis isolates from the leaf-cutter ant–microbe  symbiosis confirms specificity at the broad phylogenetic level, but reveals  frequent host-switching events between species and genera of leaf-cutter ants.  Escovopsis strains isolated from Acromyrmex and Atta gardens occur together in  the same clades, and very closely related strains can even infect the gardens  of both ant genera.&nbsp; Currie (*) recorded  the presence of multiparasite infections in single leaf-cutter ant nests, and our  results show that phylogenetically diverse strains of Escovopsis are capable of  overgrowing all leaf-cutter ant cultivars examined.&nbsp; Experimental evidence from other research  groups (*) support our finding of low host–parasite specificity (*). Thus, our  findings indicate that this host–pathogen association is shaped by the farming  ants having to protect their cultivated fungus from phylogenetically diverse  Escovopsis garden pathogens.</div><div>    </div><div></div><div>    </div><div></div><div>    </div><div>            </div>
