<div>Our  molecular phylogeny of Escovopsis isolates from the leaf-cutter ant–microbe  symbiosis confirms specificity at the broad phylogenetic level, but reveals  frequent host-switching events between species and genera of leaf-cutter ants.  Escovopsis strains isolated from Acromyrmex and Atta gardens occur together in  the same clades, and very closely related strains can even infect the gardens  of both ant genera.&nbsp; Currie (*) recorded  the presence of multiparasite infections in single leaf-cutter ant nests, and our  results show that phylogenetically diverse strains of Escovopsis are capable of  overgrowing all leaf-cutter ant cultivars examined.&nbsp; Experimental evidence from other research  groups (*) support our finding of low host–parasite specificity (*). Thus, our  findings indicate that this host–pathogen association is shaped by the farming  ants having to protect their cultivated fungus from phylogenetically diverse  Escovopsis garden pathogens.</div><div>    </div><div></div><div>    </div><div></div><div>    </div><div>Virtually  all 675 garden pieces inoculated with Escovopsis were overgrown by the  parasite. Only three garden pieces were not, but they were overgrown by another  fungus.&nbsp; Our results add to other  findings which show a strong susceptibility to infection in the cultivar. We  found that Escovopsis from leaf-cutting ant nests form a monophyletic group and  strains associated with leaf-cutting ants form two main clades. There was a  lack of genetic correlation with their ant hosts; the two main Escovopsis  clades are also uncorrelated with geography, as both clades contain isolates  from Argentina, Panama and Ecuador. In fact, the entire EF-1a gene fragment,  including the introns, is identical for some strains isolated from very  different geographical locations.</div><div>            </div>
