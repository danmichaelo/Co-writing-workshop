  abstract = {Crocin (CRO) and safranal (SAF) are bioactive constituents of saffron (dried stigma of Crocus sativus flower), an expensive spice with medicinal properties. Aqueous extract of saffron is known for its antigenotoxic effect against environmental genotoxins/carcinogens. However, there is need to identify saffron constituents responsible for this antigenotoxic effect. The aim of our investigation was to ascertain the role of CRO and SAF as inhibitors of in vivo genotoxic stress. For this purpose, Swiss albino mice were pretreated with CRO (50-mg/kg body weight (bw))/SAF (0.025- and 0.25-ml/kg bw) by gavage for 2 days. Thereafter, the pretreated mice were exposed to the genotoxic agents: (1) gamma radiation (GR; 2 Gy), (2) urethane (URE; 800 mg/kg) and (3) procarbazine (PCB; 60 mg/kg). In addition, CRO (50 mg/kg) was co-administered with the nitrosation reaction mixture of methylurea (MU; 300-mg/kg bw) + sodium nitrite (15 mg/kg) which can form N-nitroso-N-MU in the stomach. Genotoxic damage was measured by performing the bone marrow micronucleus test. Results obtained demonstrated significant reductions in the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow of mice pretreated with CRO/SAF before exposure to the above DNA damaging agents, GR, URE and PCB. Co-administration of CRO with the nitrosation reaction mixture led to significant decrease in genotoxicity when compared to nitrosation reaction mixture alone. Histopathological studies revealed that these saffron constituents reduced testicular cell damage induced by the test genotoxins. The cell-free DNA-nicking assay using pBR322 DNA showed significant protective effects of CRO against hydroxyl radical-induced strand breaks.},

  abstract = {One of the most common characteristics of cancer cells is genomic instability. Recent research has revealed that G2/M-phase checkpoint adaptation\textemdash{}entering mitosis with damaged DNA\textemdash{}contributes to genomic changes in experimental models. When cancer cells are treated with pharmacological concentrations of genotoxic agents, they undergo checkpoint adaptation; however, a small number of cells are able to survive and accumulate micronuclei. These micronuclei harbour damaged DNA, and are able to replicate and reincorporate their DNA into the main nucleus. Micronuclei are susceptible to chromothripsis, which is a phenomenon characterised by extensively rearranged chromosomes that reassemble from pulverized chromosomes in one cellular event. These processes contribute to genomic instability in cancer cells that survive a genotoxic anti-cancer treatment. This review provides insight into checkpoint adaptation and its connection to micronuclei and possibly chromothripsis. Knowledge about these mechanisms is needed to improve the poor cancer treatment outcomes that result from genomic instability.},

  abstract = {Phenolic compounds and their derivatives are ubiquitous constituents of numerous synthetic and natural chemicals that exist in the environment. Their toxicity is mostly attributed to their hydrophobicity and/or the formation of free radicals. In a continuation of the study of phenolic toxicity in a systematic manner, we have examined the biological responses of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to a series of mostly monosubstituted phenols utilizing a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) approach. The biological end points included a growth assay that determines the levels of growth inhibition induced by the phenols as well as a yeast deletion (DEL) assay that assesses the ability of X-phenols to induce DNA damage or DNA breaks. The QSAR analysis of cell growth patterns determined by IC50 and IC80 values indicates that toxicity is delineated by a hydrophobic, parabolic model. The DEL assay was then utilized to detect genomic deletions in yeast. The increase in the genotoxicity was enhanced by the electrophilicity of the phenolic substituents that were strong electron donors as well as by minimal hydrophobicity. The electrophilicities are represented by Brown's sigma plus values that are a variant of the Hammett sigma constants. A few mutant strains of genes involved in DNA repair were separately exposed to 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl-phenol (BHT) and butylated hydroxy anisole (BHA). They were subsequently screened for growth phenotypes. BHA-induced growth defects in most of the DNA repair null mutant strains, whereas BHT was unresponsive.},
